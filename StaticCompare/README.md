# Static Comparison

This plot shows the comparison of the ice caps and belt parameter space ranges for warm start planets on circular orbits of F (lightblue), G (orange), and K (red) dwarf stars, with each region is labeled accordingly.  The dashed lines between the cap and beltregions are the approximate location of the boundary between snowball and ice free ice states.

To generate the plot, type the following code:
```
