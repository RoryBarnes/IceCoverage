# Plots and Figures for 2020 Wilhelm et. al Publication
Here are the plots and figures used in the 2020 Wilhelm et. al Publication on IceBelt Formation on High Oblquity Worlds. We used VPLANET to examine the formation of equitorial ice and constucted contour plots to look at the range in which Ice Belts are present. We looked at three different spectral classes of stars: K, G and  stars. 
It is divided into 4 different cases:
 - Example Cases (where we show the different types of ice that can form on an Earth-like planet, ie Ice free, Ice Belt etc.)
 - Static Cases (In these cases oblquity and eccentricity **are static**)
 - Oscilating Cases (In these cases oblquity and eccentricity  **are oscilating**)
 - Monte Carlo Cases (The values for eccentricity, oblquity, and their amplitutes and periods **are randomly generated through uniform distribution**)
 
 For each case there are a folder for each spectral type, and they are divided up by *starting eccentricity value*. So if you wanted to look for *Static K star simulation with eccentricity of 0.2* that would be **Static/K_Star/Ecc_02**.
 
 In each of those folders is the plot generated from the data, a list file with the data, and the VSPACE input file if you would like to examine the raw data. 
 
 **NOTE: RUNNING VPLANET FOR THE SIMULATIONS TAKES A SEVERAL HOURS DUE TO THE CLIMATE MODEL**
