# Plots and Figures for 2020 Wilhelm et. al Publication

Here are the plots and figures used in the 2020 Wilhelm et. al Publication on The Ice Sheets of Earth-like Planets Orbiting FGK Stars. We used VPLANET to examine the formation of polar and equitorial ice and constucted contour plots to look at the range in which polar caps and ice belts are present. We looked at three different spectral classes of stars: K, G and F stars.
It is divided into 4 different cases:
 - Static Cases (In these cases oblquity, eccentricity, and percession angles **are static**)
 - Evolving Cases (The values for eccentricity, oblquity, and their amplitutes and periods **are randomly generated through uniform distribution**)

 For each case there are a folder for each spectral type, and they are divided up by *starting eccentricity value*. So if you wanted to look for *Static K star simulation with eccentricity of 0.2* that would be **StaticCases/K_Star/Ecc_02**.

 In each of those folders is the plot generated from the data, a list file with the data, and the VSPACE input file if you would like to examine the raw data by running the simulation on your own machine. 

 **NOTE: RUNNING VPLANET FOR THE SIMULATIONS TAKES A SEVERAL HOURS DUE TO THE CLIMATE MODEL**
