# Dynamic Case Comparison

This plot shows the outcomes of our 5 Cases of evolving planets dubbed 'Dynamic Cases', grouped by host star spectral type. Despite wide ranges of assumptions, the outcomes are relatively constant, suggesting that variations in albedo, rotational cycle, or orbital cycle do not strongly influence the climate states.

To generate the plot, type the following code:
```
python makeplot.py <pdf | png>
```

This should generate the plot:
