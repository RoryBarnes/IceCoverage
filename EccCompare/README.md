# Eccentricity Comparison

This plot shows the comparisons of ice belt regimes for planets orbiting F (top), G (middle), and K (bottom) as a function of eccentricity, with e = 0 solid, e = 0.1 dashed, e = 0.2 dotted, and e = 0.3 dash-dotted. Ice belts are unstable at e > 0.3 for G star planets and e > 0.1 for F star planets, thus the respective curves are omitted.

To generate the plot, type the following code:
```
python makeplot.py <pdf | png>
```

This should generate the plot:
