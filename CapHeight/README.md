# Cap Height Plot

This figure shows the range and average ice heights of ice caps as a function of latitude for stars orbiting F (top), G (middle) and K (bottom) dwarf stars. Note the different scales of the $x$-axes. Light grey curves show 100 randomly selected individual simulations, while black shows the average of all simulates that concluded with an ice belts. Although the averages are all symmetric about the poles, some individual ice caps are significantly displaced.

To generate the plot, type the following code:
```
python makeplot.py <pdf | png>
```
